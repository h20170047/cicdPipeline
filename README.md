# cicdPipeline
sample program to illustrate different stages done in orchestration layer of jenkins for CI/CD

This repository is for the Build a Node.js and React app with npm tutorial in the Jenkins User Documentation.

The repository contains a simple Node.js and React application which generates a web page with the content "Welcome to React" and is accompanied by a test to check that the application renders satisfactorily.

The jenkins directory contains an example of the Jenkinsfile (i.e. Pipeline) you'll be creating yourself during the tutorial and the scripts subdirectory contains shell scripts with commands that are executed when Jenkins processes the "Test" and "Deliver" stages of your Pipeline.
